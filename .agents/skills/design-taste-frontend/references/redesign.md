# Redesign

## 0. BRIEF INFERENCE (Read the Room Before Anything Else)

Before touching code or tweaking dials, **infer what the user actually wants**. Most LLM design output is bad because the model jumps to a default aesthetic instead of reading the room.

### 0.A Read these signals first
1. **Page kind** - landing (SaaS / consumer / agency / event), portfolio (dev / designer / creative studio), redesign (preserve vs overhaul), editorial / blog.
2. **Vibe words** the user used - "minimalist", "calm", "Linear-style", "Awwwards", "brutalist", "premium consumer", "Apple-y", "playful", "serious B2B", "editorial", "agency-y", "glassy", "dark tech".
3. **Reference signals** - URLs they linked, screenshots they pasted, products they named, brands they're competing with.
4. **Audience** - B2B procurement panel vs. design-conscious consumer vs. recruiter scanning a portfolio. The audience picks the aesthetic, not your taste.
5. **Brand assets that already exist** - logo, color, type, photography. For redesigns, these are starting material, not optional input (see Section 11).
6. **Quiet constraints** - accessibility-first audiences, public-sector, regulated industries, trust-first commerce, kids' products. These constraints OVERRIDE aesthetic preference.

### 0.B Output a one-line "Design Read" before generating
Before any code, state in one line: **"Reading this as: \<page kind> for \<audience>, with a \<vibe> language, leaning toward \<design system or aesthetic family>."**

Example reads:
- *"Reading this as: B2B SaaS landing for technical buyers, with a Linear-style minimalist language, leaning toward Tailwind utilities + Geist + restrained motion."*
- *"Reading this as: solo designer portfolio for hiring managers, with an editorial / kinetic-type language, leaning toward native CSS + scroll-driven animation + custom typography."*
- *"Reading this as: redesign of a public-sector service site, with a trust-first language, leaning toward GOV.UK Frontend or USWDS."*

### 0.C If the brief is ambiguous, ask one question, do not guess
Ask exactly **one** clarifying question - never a multi-question dump - and only when the design read genuinely diverges. Example: *"Should this feel closer to Linear-clean or Awwwards-experimental?"*

If you can confidently infer from context, **do not ask**. Just declare the design read and proceed.

### 0.D Anti-Default Discipline
Do not default to: AI-purple gradients, centered hero over dark mesh, three equal feature cards, generic glassmorphism on everything, infinite-loop micro-animations everywhere, Inter + slate-900. These are the LLM defaults. Reach past them deliberately based on the design read.

## 1. THE THREE DIALS (Core Configuration)

After the design read, set three dials. Every layout, motion, and density decision below is gated by these.

* **`DESIGN_VARIANCE: 8`** - 1 = Perfect Symmetry, 10 = Artsy Chaos
* **`MOTION_INTENSITY: 6`** - 1 = Static, 10 = Cinematic / Physics
* **`VISUAL_DENSITY: 4`** - 1 = Art Gallery / Airy, 10 = Cockpit / Packed Data

**Baseline:** `8 / 6 / 4`. Use these unless the design read overrides them. Do not ask the user to edit this file - overrides happen conversationally.

### 1.A Dial Inference (design read → dial values)
| Signal | VARIANCE | MOTION | DENSITY |
|---|---|---|---|
| "minimalist / clean / calm / editorial / Linear-style" | 5-6 | 3-4 | 2-3 |
| "premium consumer / Apple-y / luxury / brand" | 7-8 | 5-7 | 3-4 |
| "playful / wild / Dribbble / Awwwards / experimental / agency" | 9-10 | 8-10 | 3-4 |
| "landing page / portfolio / marketing site (default)" | 7-9 | 6-8 | 3-5 |
| "trust-first / public-sector / regulated / accessibility-critical" | 3-4 | 2-3 | 4-5 |
| "redesign - preserve" | match existing | +1 | match existing |
| "redesign - overhaul" | +2 | +2 | match existing |

### 1.B Use-Case Presets
| Use case | VARIANCE | MOTION | DENSITY |
|---|---|---|---|
| Landing (SaaS, mainstream) | 7 | 6 | 4 |
| Landing (Agency / creative) | 9 | 8 | 3 |
| Landing (Premium consumer) | 7 | 6 | 3 |
| Portfolio (Designer / studio) | 8 | 7 | 3 |
| Portfolio (Developer) | 6 | 5 | 4 |
| Editorial / Blog | 6 | 4 | 3 |
| Public-sector service | 3 | 2 | 5 |
| Redesign - preserve | match | match+1 | match |
| Redesign - overhaul | +2 | +2 | match |

### 1.C How the Dials Drive Output
Use these (or user-overridden values) as global variables. Cross-references throughout this document refer to these exact variable names - never invent aliases like `LAYOUT_VARIANCE` or `ANIM_LEVEL`.

## 11. REDESIGN PROTOCOL

This skill handles **greenfield builds AND redesigns**. Misclassifying the mode is the single biggest source of bad redesign output.

### 11.A Detect the Mode (first action)
* **Greenfield** - no existing site, or full overhaul approved. Dial baseline from Section 1.
* **Redesign - Preserve** - modernise without breaking the brand. Audit first, extract brand tokens, evolve gradually.
* **Redesign - Overhaul** - new visual language on top of existing content. Treat as greenfield for visuals; preserve content and IA.

If ambiguous, ask **once**: *"Should this redesign preserve the existing brand, or are we starting visually from scratch?"*

### 11.B Audit Before Touching
Document the current state before proposing changes:
* **Brand tokens** - primary / accent colors, type stack, logo treatment, radii.
* **Information architecture** - page tree, primary nav, key conversion paths.
* **Content blocks** - what exists, what's doing work, what's filler.
* **Patterns to preserve** - signature interactions, recognisable hero, copy voice.
* **Patterns to retire** - AI-slop tells, broken layouts, dead links, generic stock imagery, perf traps.
* **Dial reading of the existing site** - infer current `DESIGN_VARIANCE` / `MOTION_INTENSITY` / `VISUAL_DENSITY`. That's your starting point, not the baseline.
* **SEO baseline** - current ranking pages, meta titles, structured data, OG cards. **SEO migration is the #1 redesign risk.**

### 11.C Preservation Rules
* **Do not change information architecture** unless asked. Keep page slugs, anchor IDs, primary nav labels stable for SEO and muscle memory.
* **Extract brand colors before applying Section 4.2.** A brand that is already purple stays purple - apply the LILA RULE's override.
* **Preserve copy voice** unless asked for a rewrite. Visual modernisation ≠ content rewrite.
* **Honor existing accessibility wins.** Do not regress focus states, alt text, keyboard nav, contrast.
* **Respect existing analytics events.** Do not rename buttons, form fields, section IDs that downstream tracking depends on.

### 11.D Modernisation Levers (priority order)
Apply in order - stop when the brief is satisfied:
1. **Typography refresh** - biggest visual lift per unit of risk.
2. **Spacing & rhythm** - increase section padding, fix vertical rhythm.
3. **Color recalibration** - desaturate, unify neutrals, keep brand accent.
4. **Motion layer** - add `MOTION_INTENSITY`-appropriate micro-interactions to existing components.
5. **Hero & key-section recomposition** - restructure top-of-funnel using Section 10 vocabulary.
6. **Full block replacement** - only when the existing block is unsalvageable.

### 11.E Decision Tree: Targeted Evolution vs Full Redesign
* IA, content, and SEO sound → **targeted evolution** (Levers 1-4). ~70% of value at ~40% of risk.
* Visual debt is structural (broken IA, no design system, broken mobile) → **full redesign** with strict content preservation.
* Brand itself is changing → **greenfield**.

### 11.F What Never Changes Silently
Never modify without explicit user approval:
* URL structure / route slugs.
* Primary nav labels.
* Form field names or order (breaks analytics + autofill).
* Brand logo or wordmark.
* Existing legal / consent / cookie copy.
